Welcome to SFINCS's documentation!
======================================

'SFINCS' is the reduced-complexity model designed for super-fast modelling of compound flooding events in a dynamic way!

This online documentation describes the input files and parameters of the SFINCS model (Super-Fast INundation of CoastS).
The documentation is however still under construction, mail 'tim.leijnse@deltares.nl' for questions that are not answered yet by this documentation.
Also let us know when you are not yet a user of SFINCS, but are interested to get started!
The SFINCS executable is not yet shared open source, but will be in the future, and maybe in the meantime a collaboration is possible.
